	<div><h2>Leave Room to Play</h2><img src="pics/kid/1.jpg"><p>
Amy Berry incorporated a chaise and rocking chair for reading and brought the room to life with a classic toile wallpaper and framed botanical prints. Keeping most of the decor on the walls leaves more useable floor space so there's room to play.

	<div><h2>Section It Off</h2><img src="pics/kid/2.jpg"><p>

In this bedroom designed by Heidi Callier, the blush pink curtains lighten the mood and allow for a sectioned off "play zone" under the top bunks. The warm browns and woods create a warm foundation, and though each piece feels kid-friendly, it also blends right in with the style of the home as a whole.

	<div><h2>Invest in Ageless Furniture
</h2><img src="pics/kid/3.jpg"><p>

Contained by goldleaf borders, the flowers climbing up the walls of designer Marie Flanigan's newborn daughter's room are actually mural wallpaper. Today, the daybed is "a cozy spot for late-night feedings, but one day it'll be her big-girl bed, with a trundle for sleepovers," the Houston Designer says. Stylish, ageless, multi-purpose furniture is always a good investment.

	<div><h2>Display Their Passions</h2><img src="pics/kid/4.jpg"><p>

In the Hawaiian Kona-coast bedroom of a 13-year-old, surfboards pay homage to his happy place. At the occupant's request, San Francisco-based firm NICOLEHOLLIS made it a place where he can hang out with friends. "No matter the age, we always ask our clients how they live," she says.

</p></div>
	<div><h2>Go All Out</h2><img src="pics/kid/5.jpg"><p>

Is this not the coolest space you've ever laid eyes on? Designed by Elizabeth Georgantas, it has literally everything you could ever want: a distinguishable sense of place without relying on a cheesy theme; fun and one-of-a-kind architectural elements with functional value; cozy sleeping arrangements that don't take up the entire room; and plenty of accents that spark the imagination.

</p></div>
	<div><h2>Blend the Best of Both Worlds</h2><img src="pics/kid/6.jpg"><p>

Arent & Pyke opted for modern, sculptural pieces here. From the striped table lamp to the wooden stool, graphic rug, linen bedding, and eye-catching rug, everything feels both youthful and timeless.

	<div><h2>Bring In a Curly Slide</h2><img src="pics/kid/7.jpg"><p>

This isn't just any old slide, it's a curly slide. It simply doesn't get any cooler than this bedroom designed by California-based firm, Studio Life/Style. With a half-stair and half-slide hybrid, a lofted hangout zone, and a full-sized bed that still leaves room for a sitting area, we'd never leave this place.

</p></div>
	<div><h2>Choose a Cool Bed</h2><img src="pics/kid/8.jpg"><p>

To soften the punchy stripes and colors of this bedroom, designer Susana Simonpietri of Chango & Co. hung a leather headboard that will continue to work as the seven-year-old boy grows up. "It's important to keep the child's current age in mind, as well as the years ahead of him," she says.

	<div><h2>Make It a Play Room</h2><img src="pics/kid/9.jpg"><p>


Obstacle course or dream bedroom? Hao Design Studio, a Taiwan-based firm, used rounded lines and muted tones for the imaginative girls' bedroom in Kaoshiung City, describing it as "an adventure amusement park." The second level is a playhouse and that you reach by ladder while you take the slide to get down.


</p></div>
	<div><h2>Spread Some Cheer</h2><img src="pics/kid/10.jpg"><p>


If a room could be a hug, this is what it would look like. The chipper yellow gingham wallpaper envelopes the entire space designed by Shazalynn Cavin-Winfrey, unifying the many angles and corners. The architectural quirks, along with the punchy colors and fun fabrics, make it feel like a clubhouse.
